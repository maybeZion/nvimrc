# About

My personal configuration file for NeoVim.
 - Uses COQ for autocompletion
   - COQ pulls from nvim_lspconfig
 - Custom status bar, written mostly in vimscript
 - Some lua functions for linting features

# Installation

Install this file in ~/.config/nvim/init.vim, or wherever you keep your Nvim config. Then, run :PlugInstall and restart Nvim.

Windows users should consult the documentation for installation.
