# About

My personal configuration file for NeoVim. The main plugins used are ALE and COC for linting and autocompletion, plus NerdTree and FZF for file management.

# Installation

Install this file in ~/.config/nvim/init.vim, or wherever you keep your Nvim config. Then, run :PlugInstall and restart Nvim.

Windows users should consult the documentation for installation.
